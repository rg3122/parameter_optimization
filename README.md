Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. They are particularly useful for classification problems, where the goal is to assign input data to different categories based on their features.

SVMs work by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data points into different classes. This hyperplane is chosen to maximize the margin between the classes, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. The closest data points to the hyperplane are known as support vectors.

One of the key advantages of SVMs is their ability to handle high-dimensional data and be robust to outliers. SVMs can be used with both linear and non-linear decision boundaries through different kernel functions, such as polynomial or radial basis function (RBF) kernels.

SVMs are commonly used in various applications, including image and text classification, as well as bioinformatics. However, SVMs can be computationally expensive for large datasets, and the choice of kernel function and its parameters can significantly affect the performance of the algorithm.
